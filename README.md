# 🐍 Python Learning Journey & Projects

Welcome to my Python learning lab! This repository is dedicated to mastering **Python programming** from the ground up and applying what I learn through real-world mini-projects.

## 📞 Main Project: Telephone Directory
My current focus is building a **Telephone Directory** application. This project helps me practice core Python concepts such as:
* **Data Storage:** Using Dictionaries and Lists to manage contacts.
* **User Input:** Handling and validating user data (Name, Phone, etc.).
* **Operations:** Implementing Search, Add, Delete, and Update functionalities.

## 📚 Learning Roadmap
- [x] Python Syntax & Variables
- [ ] Data Structures (Lists, Dictionaries, Tuples)
- [ ] Functions & Modules
- [ ] File Handling (Saving contacts to a file)
- [ ] Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Python

## 🛠️ Technical Setup
- **Language:** Python 3.x
- **Environment:** VS Code / Anaconda
- **OS:** Windows 64-bit (Asus Vivobook)

## 💡 Why Python?
I am learning Python to strengthen my logic for **AI Research** and to build tools that simplify complex tasks. Every script in this repository is a step toward becoming a better developer.
